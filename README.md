# Array based Questions

### 🧩 Core Array Questions (Beginner Level)

- Focus: looping, push/pop, filtering, and sorting logic

- Remove duplicates from an array (DONE) 13Nov2025

- Flatten an n-dimensional array (without .flat())

- Reverse an array (without using .reverse())

- Find the maximum and minimum elements in an array

- Find the second largest (and second smallest) element

- Count the frequency of each element (return as object or Map)

- Check if two arrays are equal (same elements, any order)

- Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array

- Rotate an array by k positions (left/right rotation)

- Remove falsy values (false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN)

- Separate even and odd numbers into two arrays

- Find the sum and average of array elements

- Count occurrences of a target element in an array

- Get unique and duplicate elements separately

- Check if array is palindromic

  

### ⚙️ Intermediate Level (Logic + Functions)

- Focus: higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.)

- Implement .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() manually

- Remove duplicates using reduce()

- Find intersection and union of two arrays

- Group array elements by a property (array of objects → grouped object)

- Sort an array of objects by a specific key (e.g., age, name)

- Find the element with the highest frequency (mode)

- Chunk an array into groups of n elements

- Find all pairs of numbers that sum to a given target (two-sum)

- Find all triplets that sum to zero (three-sum)

- Implement array shuffle (Fisher–Yates algorithm)

- Remove a specific value from an array (without .filter())

- Partition array into positives/negatives or evens/odds

- Convert array of key-value pairs to object and vice versa

- Find common elements across multiple arrays

- Implement Array.prototype.flatMap() manually


### 🧠 Advanced Level (Logic + Optimization)

- Focus: recursion, in-place operations, and problem-solving

- Flatten n-dimensional array using recursion (no .flat())

- Find the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array

- Implement custom sorting (e.g., sort by string length, frequency)

- Rearrange array so that all negative numbers appear before positives

- Find the missing number in a sequence (e.g., [1, 2, 4, 5] → 3)

- Find the duplicate number in an array of integers (1–n range)

- Find the majority element (appears more than n/2 times)

- Kadane’s algorithm – find maximum subarray sum

- Spiral traversal of 2D array (matrix problems)

- Rotate a matrix (90°, 180°, 270°)

- Transpose a matrix

- Diagonal sum of a matrix

- Deep flattening array of unknown depth using stack (iterative approach)

- Implement binary search on a sorted array

- Find all subsets (power set) of an array

  

### 🧮 Bonus: Real Interview-Style Questions

- These often appear in FAANG-style or startup interviews:

- Flatten deeply nested array:�[[1, [2, [3, [4]]]]] → [1,2,3,4]

- Remove duplicates but keep order of first occurrence

- Given array of objects, remove duplicates based on a key

- Given array of timestamps or numbers, find the kth largest element

- Move all zeroes to the end without changing the order of non-zero elements

- Find the longest increasing subsequence

- Merge overlapping intervals

- Spiral print of matrix

- Generate all permutations of an array

- Find intersection between two sorted arrays (efficiently)
